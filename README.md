# My Journey with GSoC 2024 - SymPy Control Module Enhancements

Hello, dear readers!

I'm beyond excited to share some incredible news with you all! My project on "Improving and Extending the Functionalities of the Control Module" has been selected for Google Summer of Code 2024, and I’ll be working with the SymPy repository. This blog will be your front-row seat to my GSoC adventure. From the highs to the challenges, I’ll be documenting every step of this thrilling journey. You'll get an insider’s view of my experiences, the lessons I learn, and the progress I make on my project.

Expect to find regular updates and detailed insights. Whether you’re a fellow GSoC participant, a programming enthusiast, or just curious about what GSoC entails, there’s something here for you. Feel free to check out the official announcement and the complete list of selected students here.

Stay tuned, and let’s make this journey unforgettable!

## Project Details

### Community Building Period

- Familiarize with the community and codebase.
- Plan project milestones and timelines.

### Phase 1

- Adding Series, Parallel, and Feedback Interconnection between two `StateSpace` classes.

### Phase 2

- Adding a symbolic solver to find the solution of the state vector `x` using the ODE Module.
- Adding a method to get the output vector of a given `StateSpace` object.
- Adding problems related to the `StateSpace` class.

### Phase 3

- Adding PID Controller to the control module.
- Implementing a bandwidth function for `TransferFunction` class.

### Phase 4

- Refactor older control plots to use symbolic methods rather than numerical ones.
  - Control system plots like Pole Zero, Step Response, Impulse Response, Ramp Response, Bode Magnitude, and Bode Phase.
- Add newer plots in the control_plots file, such as Root Locus, Nichols, and Nyquist plots.

### End of GSoC Coding Period

- Finalize and document the work done.
- Ensure all contributions are merged into the main repository.
